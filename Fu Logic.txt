Round up to the next highest 10:



point formula:
basic points = fu*2^(2+han)
non-dealer tsumo = 2xbasic points from dealer, 1x from the other two
non-dealer ron = 4x discarder
dealer tsumo = 2x from all
dealer ron = 6x from discarder

final payments are rounded up to the next highest 100.
